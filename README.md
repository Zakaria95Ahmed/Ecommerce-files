In this Video, I have built a Angular 14  E-Commerce Website.
In this Website, I have created 
 Home Component - To display Suggested Components.
 Products Component - To Display List of Components in grid or in list layout
 Products Details Component - To Display Details of Product.
 Cart Component - To Add the Product in Cart and Save in DB
 Order Component - To Simulate the Placing Order Process like other E-Commerce Websites
 Login and Register Components - To Create Account in DB.

All this will happen without refreshing web page.
